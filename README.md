# Intro

This repo shares the raw (binary), parsed and processed spectra used to develop the general models of the Swiss mid-infrared (mid-IR) soil spectral library (SSL) in version 1. This version comes along with this open-access publication:

Baumann, P., Helfenstein, A., Gubler, A., Keller, A., Meuli, R. G., Wächter, D., Lee, J., Viscarra Rossel, R., & Six, J. (2021). Developing the Swiss mid-infrared soil spectral library for local estimation and monitoring. SOIL, 7(2), 525–546. https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-7-525-2021

The associated laboratory analytical reference data has be requested from the [Swiss Soil Monitoring (NABO)](https://www.agroscope.admin.ch/agroscope/en/home/topics/environment-resources/soil-bodies-water-nutrients/nabo.html) group at Agroscope.
